At the time of the album's release, U2 said on several occasions that they were ""reapplying for the job ... [of] the best band in the world"". U2 brought back Eno and Lanois, who had produced three of the band's previous albums.

Along with the remastered albums, there is a companion disc with each album, consisting of previously unreleased audio tracks and alternate mixes of released tracks. Many of these are described as work-in-progress or alternate mixes made during the original production rather than new remixes generated to highlight discarded recording elements (as did the remixes made for The Beatles Anthology). The first companion album consists of the 10 October 1969 concert in Paris.

Coming only four months after the controversial Self Portrait, the more concise and immediate New Morning won a much warmer reception from fans and critics. Most welcome was the return of Dylan's familiar, nasal singing voice. While he has a slightly nasal tone to his voice on ""Alberta #1"" from Self Portrait this was the first full album with his familiar voice since John Wesley Harding in 1967: he had taken on a country croon since then. In retrospect, the album has come to be viewed as one of the artist's lesser successes, especially following the release of Blood on the Tracks in 1975, often seen as a fuller return-to-form.",http://stardog.com/tutorial/If_Not_for_You
